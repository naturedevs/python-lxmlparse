            <Title>Arista Networks: ANET Analyst Day: Deep Dive on AI Opportunity</Title>
            <Abstract>Cloud and AI Innovators Analyst Day presented a deep dive into
                technology problems created by AI, and solved by Arista. As expected, financial
                targets laid out were largely as previewed on Q2/Q3 earnings, giving room for
                eventual new CFO and flexibility given customer concentration. Remain OW. Key
                takeaways Arista sees an incremental $5bn AI networking (back end) opportunity
                unfolding by 2027, part of the overall $25bn opportunity we see for cloud
                networkingAdvantages, and constant evolution, of EOS positions Arista to take
                advantage of that opportunity Enterprise / campus opportunity continues to be a
                meaningful growth driver10-12% growth targets for 2024 were about in-line with
                investor expectations, mid-teens for '22 - '27 slightly less aggressive than
                hoped for We attended Arista's 2023 Cloud and AI Innovators event virtually on
                Thursday, November 9th. AI creates networking problems, Arista developing
                solutions. Our move to OW recently was driven by the idea that Arista was best
                able to capitalize on large opportunity created by AI and the accompanying
                bandwidth increase both in training and utilizing LLMs. Arista's Analyst Day
                dove deep into the complex traffic patterns / load balancing conflicts AI
                traffic creates and how EOS is best able to resolve these. By resolving these
                problems, they see increasing ways in which Arista can participate in the AI
                networking opportunity ($5bn by 2027), which they classify as just the back end
                or training opportunity largely being served by InfiniBand today. We think this
                $5bn is a part of an overall $25bn cloud networking opportunity by 2027,
                servicing not only training needs, but the increase in inference use cases and
                continued move of workloads to the cloud, and part of the $60bn opportunity
                Arista sees for itself in total (including AI, cloud, enterprise). We walked
                away continuing to believe in the strength of Arista's positioning. The quicker
                trialing / refining can be done, the sooner Arista can capitalize on AI
                networking opportunity. Arista laid out a $750mm 2025 target for revenue they
                would classify as AI networking (back end, or for use in training). This does
                not include revenue they may get from inference use cases, which we would
                classify as a bigger opportunity and one they are well positioned for. As we
                noted in our upgrade, Ethernet is already being trialed by META for LLaMA2
                clusters (META is covered by Brian Nowak). Given these trials are ongoing, we
                asked the company what learnings they have in early days from these trials and
                others, and how to turn trials into achieving the $750mm targets. They noted
                that with refining, both on how customers configure networks and improvements
                they have made to EOS, they are seeing the evidence that performance gaps to
                InfiniBand are closing, but it requires iterations from both parties. They also
                noted that trials are largely being done at 400G, where actually implementations
                would take place at 800G, helping further improve performance. Campus /
                enterprise remain meaningful opportunities, particularly as security needs grow.
                While most of the Analyst Event focused on the AI opportunity, the company also
                laid out the large enterprise opportunity they see. Much of the focus was
                highlighting how Arista's CloudVision common management plane simplifies and
                secures customer networks, helping the company gain share in data center and on
                campus. Adding more security elements into CloudVision, Arista announced their
                Zero Trust Networking Vision. Their approach is focused on leveraging the
                network to eliminate blindspots and silos in the network. They are partnering
                with Microsoft, Crowdstrike and Zscaler (newly announced) as a part of this
                initiative. Arista reiterated the campus goal of $750mm of campus revenue by
                2025, largely achieved without need of a channel, though channel investment
                continues. Financial outlook largely as expected, few changes to the model. The
                company laid out targets for 10-12% revenue growth in '24 and mid-teens growth
                from '22-'27 (as shown in 2). As a result, we are raising our top-line estimates
                for ANET in FY24, largely to account for stronger growth expectations with the
                Cloud Titans and Tier 2 customers. Our margins remain largely the same for FY24
                and FY25 top-line growth remains the same, however FY25 gross margins come down
                slightly due to customer mix (e.g. more cloud revenue). Net result is our new
                non-GAAP FY24 and FY25 revenue / EPS estimates moving up to $6,487.2mm / $7.07
                and $7,198.5mm / $7.55 from $6,418.3mm / $7.03 and $7,125.8mm / $7.59
                previously. We would note that '24 company outlook was largely in-line with
                investor expectations, but '22-'27 revenue growth CAGR may have been slightly
                short of expectations. We think given upcoming CFO transition and uncertainty in
                800G outcomes/timing, initial targets could eventually prove conservative.
                Remain OW, $220PT. While we acknowledge that Arista's current valuation is not
                cheap, we think it is the best exposed of our coverage universe to eventual AI
                networking investment, and as a result we are willing to pay a premium for the
                name (more in-line with software averages). In our scenario analysis, we think
                the earnings power of the company could reach $8.5 by 2025, making PT ~25x (or
                ~28x Street). This is in-line with software multiples, which has been how the
                company has traditionally traded. Our $220 PT is 28x 25e P/E from 27x 24e P/E.
                Our bull case valuation is $275, or 32x a bull 25e P/E, with 32x representative
                of faster growing software names. Our bear case valuation is $120, with 18x
                representing the minimum the name has traditionally traded at (on 24e earnings).
                Biggest risks to price target are meaningful pullback in cloud capex spend,
                share loss at 800G, and InfiniBand making headway as the de facto AI standard.
